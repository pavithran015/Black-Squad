# Black-Squad
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
. A young unlicensed driver died in 44.1% of the crashes. Unlicensed drivers are generally unknown to authorities until they crash or commit a traffic violation, which results in a suspected large number of drivers with unknown risks and driving practices. So we came up with a solution called smart RFID license card reader which inspects whether the driver is an authorized license holder and provide access to start the engine only when they have license with them. 

TECHNOLOGY USED:
1. Internet of Things
2. Image processing
4. Python open CV 

ABSTRACT BRIEF:
            Previous studies have indicated that unlicensed drivers are more likely to engage in risky driving behaviours, and are more likely than licensed drivers to be at fault and more seriously injured when involved in a crash.A young unlicensed driver died in 44.1% of the crashes.
             A camera is mounted on the dashboard which monitors the rider while he starts the vehicle. System uses python open CV for recognizing the face at real time with high level of accuracy. Smart RFID license card reader is integrated with the dashboard, It is to insure that the rider is a license holder. The rider needs to scan his/her license in the Smart RFID license card reader integrated to the dashboard. Using IOT the real time image of the rider is captured using camera and compared with their license in the Database. This system allows to start the vehicle only if the rider is a license card holder.
